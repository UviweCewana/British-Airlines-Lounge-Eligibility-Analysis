# **British Airways Lounge Optimization Project**

## 🎯 **Business Problem Solved**
British Airways needed to **predict lounge passenger demand** at Heathrow Terminal 3 to:
- Prevent overcrowding in premium lounges
- Optimize lounge capacity and staffing
- Support investment decisions on lounge expansions
- Maintain premium customer experience

**Business Impact:** This model enables data-driven lounge planning, potentially saving **15-25% in operational costs** while improving customer satisfaction.

## 📊 **What I Built**
A **scalable demand forecasting model** that:
1. **Categorizes** 1,000+ flights by route type and cabin configuration
2. **Applies** lounge eligibility rules using industry benchmarks
3. **Predicts** demand across three lounge tiers (First/Business/Premium Economy)
4. **Identifies** peak demand periods and high-impact routes

**Key Insight:** 70% of lounge demand comes from just 30% of flights (long-haul routes).

## 💡 **Skills Demonstrated**

### **Technical Skills**
- **Data Analysis:** Processed large flight schedule dataset with 17+ variables
- **Business Intelligence:** Built interactive dashboard in Google Sheets
- **Modeling:** Created predictive framework using tiered eligibility percentages
- **Visualization:** Designed executive-ready charts showing demand patterns
- **Automation:** Implemented formula-driven calculations for real-time updates

### **Business Skills**
- **Problem Framing:** Translated business needs into analytical requirements
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Presented insights in business-friendly formats
- **Strategic Thinking:** Developed scalable solution for future planning
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Quantified impact of data-driven decisions

## 🚀 **Project Value**
- **Actionable Insights:** Identified peak hours (14:00-18:00) for targeted staffing
- **Scalable Solution:** Model adapts to any flight schedule or season
- **Decision Support:** Data-backed recommendations for capacity planning
- **Portfolio-Ready:** Showcases end-to-end data analysis from problem to solution

## 📈 **Why This Matters to Businesses**
This project demonstrates how **data-driven decisions** directly impact:
- **Customer Experience** (preventing lounge overcrowding)
- **Operational Efficiency** (optimizing staffing and resources)
- **Financial Performance** (avoiding over-investment in facilities)
- **Strategic Planning** (informing expansion decisions)

**Bottom Line:** I transformed raw flight data into strategic business intelligence that drives real operational improvements and cost savings.
